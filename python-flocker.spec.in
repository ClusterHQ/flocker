%description
Flocker is an open-source volume manager and multi-host Docker container
orchestration tool.  With it you can control your data using the same tools you
use for your stateless applications.  This means that you can run your
databases, queues and key-value stores in Docker and move them around as easily
as the rest of your app.

This package provides the libraries for the frontend and node software.
