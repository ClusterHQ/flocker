# The whole file is a list of examples.  Unless otherwise indicated, examples
# are independent of each other.  For complicated examples that involve state
# that can't be established using a single HTTP request, requirements (in the
# form of other examples) can be declared.
#
# Some variable substitution is done to some of the content in this file.  The
# details of what and how are explained below but here is the list of variables
# that are globally defined and always available to be substituted:
#
# DOMAIN - The domain name of the cluster API server.
#
# NODE_N - The UUID specifically identifying one of the nodes of the
#     cluster.  Use any integer suffix for N starting with 0.  For example,
#     NODE_3 is replaced with the UUID for a hypothetical fourth cluster
#     node.  (Only NODE_0 and NODE_1 are implemented.  See FLOC-1288.)

-
  # Every element must have a unique identifier.  Documentation can use these
  # identifiers to select examples to include.  Examples can also declare other
  # examples as dependencies using this identifier.
  id:
    "get version"

  # Every example has docs explaining what it is an example of.
  doc: |
    Retrieve the version of the Flocker cluster.

  # Half of the example is the HTTP request you issue to trigger some behavior.
  # The harness knows this is HTTP so it turns this pseudo-HTTP into real HTTP
  # that can be rendered into the documentation or issued against a server for
  # validation.  Host (DOMAIN) and Content-Type (application/json) headers will
  # be automatically inserted.  %(VARIABLES)s in the request body get values
  # substituted in for them.
  request: |
    GET /v1/version HTTP/1.1

  # The other half of the example is the HTTP response you'll get if you do
  # this.  Ditto about the harness translating pseudo-HTTP into real HTTP.

  doc: |
    Specifying as few parameters as possible, create a new dataset on the
    cluster.  A node is specified to have the primary manifestation for the new
    dataset.  The unique dataset identifier is automatically generated by the
    server and returned with the response. When the ``maximum_size`` parameter
    is omitted, the dataset will have a default size of ``100GiB``. The default
    may change (:issue:`2679`) so it is advisable to always specify the
    ``maximum_size``.
